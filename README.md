Studying online comes with a new set of challenges. According to us, the biggest problems that we faced are:  
Organising all the study material posted on Google classroom (including sources posted in comments and elsewhere) and getting them at one place.
Searching for a particular topic or keyword from the video lectures and slides.
As we have joined the college just one month ago so, we need information on various aspects related to our college.

EDUbuddy spans the gap between Online education and Learning by:
Grouping all the material on google classroom into one Drive folder for each subject separately.
Extracting specific sections of a video for a specific topic or keyword.

Seekerbot caters to satisfy our hunger for answers about queries related to our Institution.
